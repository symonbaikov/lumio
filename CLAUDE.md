Behavioral guidelines to reduce common LLM coding mistakes. Merge with project-specific instructions as needed.

Tradeoff: These guidelines bias toward caution over speed. For trivial tasks, use judgment.

## 1. Think Before Coding

Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.

Before implementing:
- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them - don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

## 2. Simplicity First

Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

## 3. Surgical Changes

Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.

When editing existing code:
- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it - don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:
- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

The test: Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

## 4. Goal-Driven Execution

Define success criteria. Loop until verified.

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:
- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]

Strong success criteria let you loop independently. Weak criteria ("make it work") require constant clarification.

These guidelines are working if: fewer unnecessary changes in diffs, fewer rewrites due to overcomplication, and clarifying questions come before implementation rather than after mistakes.

## Project Context (Lumio)

Detailed policy lives in `.claude/rules/*.md` (security, database, idempotency, api-standards, clean-architecture, frontend-perf, observability, best-practices). Read those before changes in those domains.

## Quick Commands

```bash
# Dev (Docker, full stack)
make quick-dev                    # one-shot dev bring-up
make dev                          # docker compose dev with hot reload

# Build / test / lint
npm --prefix backend run test:e2e
npm --prefix backend run test:golden   # parsing golden tests (GOLDEN_ENABLED=1)
npm --prefix backend run lint:fix      # Biome only
npm --prefix frontend run lint:fix     # Biome AND ESLint (both run)
npm --prefix backend run typecheck
npm --prefix frontend run type-check

# Migrations (TypeORM)
npm run migration:run                         # prod path: builds scripts, uses migration lock
npm --prefix backend run migration:run:dev    # dev path: ts-node, no lock
npm run migration:generate -- src/migrations/<Name>
```

## Gotchas

- Frontend lint runs **both** Biome and ESLint — fixing one but not the other leaves CI red.
- `prebuild` and `postinstall` on the frontend run `intlayer build`; deleting the intlayer config or skipping it breaks both install and build.
- Backend dev uses a manual nodemon command, not `nest start`, and bumps Node heap to 2 GB.
- Always run migrations via the npm scripts, not raw `typeorm` — `migration:run` acquires a lock to prevent concurrent runs in deployment.
- Tenant isolation: every backend query must filter by `workspaceId`. See `.claude/rules/security.md`.
