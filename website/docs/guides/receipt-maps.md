title: Receipt Maps
description: Self-hosted receipt locations, tiles, and geocoding
---

Receipt details can show where a purchase was made on a map. Everything runs on your own
infrastructure: no public map or geocoding service is called.

## Where the point comes from

In order of priority:

1. **Manual pin or picked shop** — a point the user placed, or a shop chosen from the list of
   places nearby (see below). Automatic updates never replace either.
2. **Merchant address** — the address parsed from the receipt, geocoded with Nominatim.
3. **Photo GPS** — the EXIF location of the uploaded photo.
4. **Device position** — only for receipts shot with the in-app camera.

The device position is requested only after the user agrees. The choice is stored per device, and
after a refusal Lumio does not ask again; it can be changed later in the Data tab of the profile
settings.

## Asking for the shop when GPS was missing

Phones often lose GPS inside a shop. When a receipt is shot with the camera and the phone has no fix,
or only a rough one (worse than 100 m), Lumio remembers the receipt on that device and waits for GPS
to come back:

- while the app stays on screen, for up to 20 minutes after the photo;
- if the app was closed, one short attempt each time it is opened again, for up to 2 hours.

With a fix it asks the backend for named places around it — shops, cafés, pharmacies, fuel stations
and similar, with a name matching the receipt's vendor first — and shows a small card: **Choose
shop** opens the list, **✕** stops asking about that receipt, **Don't show again** turns the question
off on that device (it can be turned back on in the Data tab of the profile settings). Nothing is
asked when the store address on the receipt was already geocoded or the user placed the point.

The queue lives in the browser and holds no coordinates. A position taken after leaving the shop is
only used for the search and is not stored unless the user picks a shop. Browsers do not share
location with a web app in the background, so the question only appears while Lumio is open.

## Enable it

```bash
# Optional: the OSM extract for your region (defaults to Kazakhstan)
echo 'MAP_PBF_URL=https://download.geofabrik.de/europe/switzerland-latest.osm.pbf' >> .env
docker compose --profile maps --profile geocoder up -d
```

Then point the backend at the services and restart it:

```bash
TILESERVER_URL=http://tileserver:8080
GEOCODER_URL=http://nominatim:8080
MAP_DEFAULT_STYLE=osm-bright   # optional
```

- The `maps` profile prepares style assets (`map-assets`), builds vector tiles from the extract with
  Planetiler once (`map-tiles-init`) and serves them with tileserver-gl (`tileserver`).
- The `geocoder` profile runs Nominatim on the same extract. On every start it also imports the
  kinds of places from `infra/nominatim/special-phrases.csv`; without them Nominatim cannot search
  "supermarkets near a point" and only the vendor name search works.
- The first import takes minutes for a small country and hours for a large one, and needs several GB
  of disk (`map_data` and `nominatim_data` volumes).
- Without `TILESERVER_URL` the map reports that tiles are not configured; without `GEOCODER_URL`
  receipts fall back to the photo or device point.

## Styles and tiles

Four styles are served: OSM Bright (`osm-bright`), Positron (`positron`), Dark Matter
(`dark-matter`) and Basic (`basic`). Users switch styles on the map; the choice is saved to their
profile. `MAP_DEFAULT_STYLE` picks the style for users who have not chosen one, otherwise the first
style is used.

The browser never talks to the tile server — the backend proxies it, so `tileserver` has no public
port:

- `GET /api/v1/maps/styles` — available styles and the default style
- `GET /api/v1/maps/tiles/:styleId/:z/:x/:y` — a PNG tile (signed-in users only, exempt from rate
  limiting)

## API

- `PATCH /api/v1/receipts/:id/location` with `{ "latitude": 43.2383, "longitude": 76.9453 }` pins a
  receipt manually.
- `DELETE /api/v1/receipts/:id/location` drops the manual pin and recomputes the point from the
  merchant address or the photo.

- `PATCH` with a `place` object (`name`, `category`, `osmType`, `osmId`) stores a shop picked from
  the list; its source is `place`.
- `POST /api/v1/receipts/place-suggestions` with `{ "statementId", "latitude", "longitude",
  "accuracy" }` returns `{ "needed": false }` when the shop is already known, or up to eight named
  places within 150–500 m. The position travels in the body so it stays out of access logs.

All of them require the statement edit permission.
