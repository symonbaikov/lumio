description: Unit, integration, and e2e test guidance

Lumio uses Jest for the backend and Vitest for the frontend. CI runs the backend unit and e2e suites against
PostgreSQL 16 and Redis 7 service containers.

## Backend tests (Jest)

```bash
cd backend
npm test               # unit tests: @tests/**/*.spec.ts
npm run test:e2e       # e2e tests: @tests/e2e/**/*.e2e-spec.ts (needs PostgreSQL and Redis)
npm run test:cov       # unit tests with coverage
npm run test:ci        # unit (in band) + e2e, as in CI
npm run test:golden    # parser golden tests
npm run test:parsing   # parsing regression spec
```

Tests live under `backend/@tests`: `unit`, `integration`, `e2e`, `fixtures`, and `helpers`.

## Frontend tests (Vitest)

```bash
cd frontend
npm test
```

Run them from `frontend/`. Tests sit next to the code as `*.test.ts` / `*.test.tsx`. CI does not run them.

## Coverage

The backend unit config enforces a global floor of 8% statements, 5% branches, 8% functions, and 8% lines; the
frontend has no threshold. Cover the code you change.
