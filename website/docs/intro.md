description: What Lumio is and who it helps
---

Lumio is an open-source, self-hosted financial data platform for importing, processing, and analyzing bank
statements. It combines a NestJS API, a Next.js web app, and a structured parsing pipeline so teams can turn messy
exports into reliable, queryable financial data.

## What you can do with Lumio

- Import statements from PDF, CSV, XLSX, DOCX, and image files, with OCR for scans and native parsers for Kaspi,
  Bereke, and Bank Hapoalim / Isracard.
- Normalize, deduplicate, and classify transactions with rules and AI-assisted categorization.
- Collect receipts by upload or from an IMAP inbox and see where each was bought on a self-hosted map
  ([Receipt Maps](guides/receipt-maps)).
- Manage multi-tenant workspaces with RBAC and full audit history.
- Build dashboards, reports, budgets, and goals; draft VAT returns and year-end income tax declarations
  ([Income Tax Declaration](guides/income-tax-declaration)).

## Who Lumio is for

- Developers evaluating a production-ready financial data pipeline
- Contributors building new parsers and integrations
- Teams self-hosting a reliable statement import stack
